A recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game built in Unity using C# scripting. This project is perfect for learning 2D game development, physics-based gameplay, and Unity's GameObject components.

Features:
Simple and addictive gameplay mechanics
Player-controlled bird movement using physics
Procedurally generated obstacles for infinite gameplay
Score tracking system
Restart functionality for continuous play
Optimized for performance

Learning Highlights:
Implementing physics-based controls with Rigidbody2D
Using Unity components like Sprites, Colliders, and UI elements
Generating dynamic game levels with obstacle spawning
Game loop and scene management in Unity
